==============

A battle for life and death in the stars.

==============
SDL2 and SDL2_TTF are installed on Mike's home directory. We've hardcoded the includes to point to that location.

On any of the NUCs, in the project root type "source loadSDL.sh"

This puts the SDL and SDL_TTF libraries in your path. It also loads the Intel module to save time.
